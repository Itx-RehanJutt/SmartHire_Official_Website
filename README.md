# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## How to Get the Latest Code from Main Repo and Continue Your Work
- If you're not already inside your project folder, go to it: (cd CodeCelix_Official_Website)
- Add the Main Repo as "Upstream" (Only once do this) i.e., (git remote add upstream https://github.com/QasimFullStackDeveloper/CodeCelix_Official_Website.git)
- You can check if it worked: (git remote -v)
- git fetch upstream
- git checkout main
- git merge upstream/main
- git push origin main
- Now go back to the branch you were working in: (git checkout feature/your-feature-name)
- git merge main

## Note: To keep our codebase clean and stable, direct push to main is not allowed. All changes must go through a pull request (PR).
